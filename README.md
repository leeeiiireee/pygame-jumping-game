# Python game inspired by the doodle jump mobile game using pygame

# I made this game for my uni course programing and algorithms 1.

# To play the game you need the character png and code file in the same folder. I've used a pink cartoon cat as my character but you can use any png you want, just make sure to change the file name on the code and you might have to change some size parameters so that the player fits better on the game (I changed it to a picture of my own cat once, made it even better :D ).

# The player automatically jumps, you just need to move left or right with the arrow keys. The first 7 platforms are always the same but the next ones are random. Every platform you pass is a point you get. Every 15pts the background changes to a random color, as if you are on a new level.

# You have the ability to do a double-jump, however they are not unlimited. You start with a few of them and every 50pts you gain another one. 

# I used this tutorial as a game-guide to further understand pygame: https://youtu.be/qmcgrk5KfHQ?si=gqMbKBy8PjangHkm

# Enjoy!!
